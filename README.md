  <h1>I am a Millenial. And This Is My Hustle Manifesto.</h1>
  <ul>
  <li>I believe in the person I want to become.</li>
  <li>A moment of patience in a moment of anger saves you a hundred moments of regret.</li>
  <li>If you are persistent, you will get it. If you are consistent, you will keep it</li>
  <!--97% of people who gave up are employed by the 3% who never give up-->
  <li>If we wait until we're ready, we'll be waiting for the rest of our lives.</li>
  <li>SUCCESS IS NO ACCIDENT. It is hardwork, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice, and most of all, love of what you are doing. -Pele</li>
